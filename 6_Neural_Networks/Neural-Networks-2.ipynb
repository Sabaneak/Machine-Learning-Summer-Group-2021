    "In this 2$^{nd}$ part of Neural Networks we'll look at the optimization function that we'll be using for a Neural Network. We'll also look at Backpropagation, an algorithm that revolutionalized parameter learning in Neural Networks. After that we'll take a look at a modified Gradient Descent algorithm called Mini-batch Gradient Descent and then briefly look at multiclass classification. Finally we'll sum up Neural Networks and take a look at the workflow of a Neural Network model. So this is going to be a long notebook but you're going to learn a lot and by the end of this notebook you'll have successfully unmasked this black box called Neural Networks. So, before we dive into all these new concepts, let's take a brief look at Part 1 and note the important points to remember."

    "## 3. Mini-batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "While working with Neural Networks, we generally deal with large amount of data. Suppose you are dealing with a dataset having 500,000 training examples. Then during forward propagation, how many examples do you need to process to perform a single step of gradient descent? All 500,000 of them, since we are taking it as a single matrix. As the Neural Network becomes deeper (i.e, th nuumber of layers increase) the computation becomes more and more expensive. So mini-batch gradient descent divides the training set into smaller 'mini-batches' and processes one mini-batch for a single gradient descent step. Let's look into this in a little more detail.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our training set with 500,000 examples. Now let's divide this training set into mini-batches of 1000 examples. To do this we first randomly shuffle the training data i.e, columns in $X$ and <b>corresponding</b> columns in $Y$. Once this is done, we take the first 1000 examples i.e, the first 1000 columns of $X$ and <b>corresponding</b> columns in $Y$ (remember that in $X$ and $Y$ columns refer to training examples) and call it mini-batch $1$ i.e, $( X^{\\{1\\}}, Y^{\\{1\\}})$. We take the next 1000 examples similarly and call it mini-batch $2$ i.e, $( X^{\\{2\\}}, Y^{\\{2\\}})$ and so on. In the end, for 500,000 examples we'll have 500 mini-batches with 1000 examples each.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we take each mini-batch instead of the entire training set and perform one step of gradient descent on it. So for example, our forward propagation equation which was $Z^{[1]} = W^{[1]}.X + b^{[1]}$ will become, $Z^{[1]} = W^{[1]}.X^{\\{t\\}} + b^{[1]}$ for the $t^{th}$ mini-batch. We also use this mini-batch to perform one step of gradient descent. So by the time we use the entire training set once, we would have performed 500 steps of gradient descent, where on the other hand in the previous algorithm one pass through the training set would perform a single step of gradient descent.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "One pass through the entire training set i.e, one iteration over all the mini-batches is called 1 <b>epoch</b>. So we can have multiple epochs to perform multiple passes through the training set."

    "While the Weights and Biases are <b>parameters</b> that your model learns on its own, there are some parameters which it can't learn. These parameters are called <b>hyperparameters</b> and are manually set by the ML engineer. You've already come across many hyperparameters. The number of layers, The number of units in each layer, Activation functions, Learning rate, Mini-batch size, Number of epochs are all hyperparameters. By tuning the hyperparameters, you can improve the performance of the model. In fact, if you've read the \"Introduction to ML\" article, you would have seen a step called \"Cross-Validation\". That step is generally used for hyperparameter tuning."

    "Deep Learning is a sub-field of Machine Learning that deals with Supervised and Unsupervised Learning using Networks. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which you have just learnt is the first step in Deep Learning. Other Neural Networks include, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are used for tasks like image recognition; Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) which are used for Sequence Models like Speech Recognition, Time Series Analysis, Natural Language Processing etc. Deep Learning is a vast field and has lots of applications in the real world."
